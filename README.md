### Description

This website allows a user to build their own pizza to order from Knight Pizza Co. The site will allow the user to pick their toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order, and the site will return the cost for the pizza.

The user must select a minimum of 2 toppings and a size in order for the price to be calculated.
